
### Instructions on how to run the test cases:
> Disclaimer: Due to lack of clarification, I have assumed that in case of one item being insufficient whole order will be returned as [].
- I have used python as programming language and unittest framework for testing.
> In terminal, at the current directory, run:
```
python test.py
```
- This file has all the test cases which will be run simultaneously. <br/>
- For each case that passes, there will be a **.** and for each case that fails there will be a **F** in the terminal.

Example of 9 test cases all of which passes:
